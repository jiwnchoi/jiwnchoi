Hello! 안녕! I am **Jason Choi (최지원)**, a Software Engineer and Research Scientist specializing in Information Visualization and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). I previously served as a Research Assistant at the [Interactive Data Computing Lab](https://idclab.skku.edu), under the supervision of [Prof. Jaemin Jo](https://www.jaeminjo.com). My industry experience includes internships as a Research Engineer at [NAVER HyperCLOVA](https://clova.ai/en) and as a Frontend Software Engineering Intern at [NAVER Smart Studio](https://smartstudio.tech).

My research focuses on automating data analysis to make these tasks more accessible to a broader audience.
To this end, I design novel algorithms, leveraging algorithms such as deep learning, and develop interaction techniques.
My work has been published in leading visualization venues, including IEEE VIS, IEEE PacificVis, and EG/IEEE EuroVis.
I am also passionate about translating my research into practical, open-source software using modern web technologies.

I received a Master of Engineering degree in Computer Science & Engineering in 2025, and a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science Education in 2023 from [Sungkyunkwan University](https://www.skku.edu/eng/index.do).
