## Abstract

In this paper, we present VANAS, a system that analyzes and visualizes the results of the Neural Architecture Search (NAS) algorithm. First, We devised several algorithms to quantify the significance and contribution of edges, and to recommend neural architecture to users, in order to efficiently convey the vast search results. We created an overview panel to check the overall characteristics of the search space, as well as a user interface to design and analyze the neural network, based on our algorithms. We demonstrated that by analyzing NAS-Bench-101 using VANAS, users can check the importance and significance of nodes and edges that compose neural networks, and that the accuracy can be increased by adding edges recommended by VANAS.
