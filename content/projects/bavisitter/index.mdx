## Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable versatility
in visualization authoring, but often generate suboptimal designs that are invalid
or fail to adhere to design guidelines for effective visualization. We present Bavisitter,
a natural language interface that integrates established visualization design guidelines
into LLMs. Based on our survey on the design issues in LLM-generated visualizations,
Bavisitter monitors the generated visualizations during a visualization authoring
dialogue to detect an issue. When an issue is detected, it intervenes in the dialogue,
suggesting possible solutions to the issue by modifying the prompts. We also demonstrate
two use cases where Bavisitter detects and resolves design issues from the actual
LLM-generated visualizations.
